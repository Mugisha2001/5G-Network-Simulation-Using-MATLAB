Latency vs Throughput:

This graph typically shows the inverse relationship between latency and throughput in 5G networks. As latency decreases (indicating faster response times), throughput tends to increase (indicating higher data transfer rates). This illustrates how the low-latency design of 5G facilitates high-speed data transfer.
Reliability Analysis:

The reliability graph demonstrates the probability of successful data transmission in the network. A higher reliability value indicates fewer data losses, which is crucial for critical applications such as autonomous driving or healthcare, where data integrity is paramount. Variations in the reliability curve can reflect changes in signal quality or network load.
Network Traffic/Load:

Graphs depicting network traffic or load in terms of the number of devices or data volume will illustrate the networkâ€™s ability to handle large numbers of devices (mMTC). Higher traffic levels could show performance degradation, highlighting the importance of efficient network management in 5G systems.

he command window results will display key performance metrics such as:
Average Latency: Time taken for data to travel from source to destination in the network.
Throughput: The overall rate of successful data transfer across the network.
Reliability Factor: A percentage that indicates how often data is successfully delivered.
These results help to quantify the performance of the simulated 5G network, providing insights into the trade-offs between latency, throughput, and reliability under different conditions (e.g., varying signal strengths, number of devices, and network configurations).
